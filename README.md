# Predicting Box Office Revenue
For our machine learning project, we will be predicting, analyzing, and visualizing movie box office revenue totals based on a number of different attributes. 
## Dataset Source:
    https://www.kaggle.com/  
    tmdb-box-office-prediction/data 
    AWS Loading: s3://boxofficepredictions/Merged_Frames.csv

# Cleaning and preprocessing
We will then clean and preprocess the data and apply machine learning models to predict and visualize the accuracy of the model and will present our findings through a public tableau dashboard.

Machine Learning Library: Scikit-Learn using supervised learning 

We will do this by using Pythons Pandas, matplotlib, and Tableau
